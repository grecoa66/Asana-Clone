# Asana Clone

This project was part of an informal hackathon for Dust Identity.

The purpose of this project was to evaluate ShadCN and V0 (Vercel) for building the UI of a Remix project.

The instructions were to build a clone of the popular project management system "asana". This demo was focused on the UI. We did not integrate with any backend services.

I used CodeSanbox to build out the demo. I started the project with the Remix template. I added Tailwind and ShadCN as dependencies.
